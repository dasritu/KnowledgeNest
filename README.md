# KnowledgeNest
The ‘KnowledgeNest’ is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline and enhance the efficiency of the library processes within a college environment. This system provides a user-friendly platform for students to access, request, and manage their book selections seamlessly.
Upon logging into their profiles, students can search for books, request titles of interest, and monitor the status of their requests. The administrative module empowers the librarian to oversee and control the library inventory, including the ability to add, edit, or delete books.
To ensure responsible borrowing, students are restricted to requesting a maximum of five books. Additionally, the system imposes constraints on users with overdue books from the previous semester, restricting further book requests until the overdue items are returned.
Administrators play a pivotal role in the approval process. Once a student's book request is submitted, administrators have the authority to approve or deny the request. Approved books are then visible in the student's profile, facilitating easy tracking and monitoring.

In addition to book management, the system enables administrators to handle student accounts efficiently. This includes the ability to manage student profiles, renew books, and apply fines for overdue returns. The integrated features of this system contribute to an organized and efficient library management process, benefiting both students and administrators alike.
